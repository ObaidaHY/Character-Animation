# Animated Characters Web Page

This repository contains a simple web page that allows users to display animated characters on a fixed-sized animation container. Users can choose to import pictures either from the internet using image URLs or directly from their local devices by selecting image files. The characters can be moved using the keyboard arrow keys once they are added to the animation container.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. On the web page, you will see a single option for adding characters:

   - **Add Character:** Click on the "+" button to add a character. A file dialog will open, allowing you to choose an image file from your local device.

4. Select an image file from your computer using the file dialog.

5. The character will be displayed in the animation container. Click on the character to focus it, and you can move the focused character using the keyboard arrow keys.

6. Repeat the process to add more characters to the animation container.
